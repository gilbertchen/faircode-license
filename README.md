# The Faircode License

[See the full license text here](License.md)

This is the public repository of the Faircode License. It's a young and experimental license for people who want to make a living from their code by selling licenses to companies and organizations. It's meant to be an alternative to, or complement to, [OSI](https://opensource.org/) Open Source licenses.

The goals for this license are:

- It should foster collaboration, openness and creativity.
- It should enable creators of software to charge for their work.
- It should be short and comprehensible.
- It should be easy and clear for companies to work with, even when licensing thousands of packages.
- It should not dictate what you do with the income. For-profit or for-charity should work equally well.

There are two ways to use the license:

- Use it as the single license of your project.
- Dual license with an Open Source license. This makes your project both OSI Open Source and Faircode, and users of it may choose to license it under either terms. Usually this is done with a protective copyleft license, such as GPLv3 which requires users to contribute back to Open Source by releasing anything built with it under the same license.

The motivation behind creating this license is that we want to enable people to work on what they're passionate about. If you love programming, and you're creating something awesome, you should be able to easily charge those who can afford for using that, so that you can keep doing it. We're programmers ourselves and would like to have the opportunity to do this ourselves. We also think this is in the interest of companies, who by paying for the software they rely on can increase chances it doesn't become abandoned as the developers get burned out.

Although the license is made to work well on the [Faircode](https://faircode.io) platform, we don't want it to be limited to that. It should work equally well if you want to use it independently or with other platforms.

## Roadmap to 1.0

Currently the license is in an alpha stage. The roadmap towards a 1.0 release is as follows:

- Now until Feb 1st 2018: **Alpha period.** We'll iterate the license based on how people use it and the feedback we get.
- After Feb 1st 2018: **Review period.** At this point we get the lawyers involved. We'll clean up any legal kinks and specks that make things needlessly ambiguous or unclear. We'll continuously merge changes back to the repo so people can see what's going on.
- When the review is done: **1.0 release.**

The work doesn't stop after 1.0 though, it's just the first milestone to have a workable license. After that we'll iterate and improve as needed, depending on what real world problems and solutions we see.

## How can I help?

We do not accept PRs, but we do read issues and comments. Feel free to post your feedback; we might not be able to respond to all of it but we'll do our best. We think above all it's important we have a debate about this; the Faircode License is meant to be _a_ solution to a problem, but there will likely be cases where it doesn't fit. Through a debate we may inspire other solutions as well.

Some things we'd love to hear about:

- How you use the Faircode License, or how you want to use it.
- Problems using the Faircode License would raise or are raising for you.
- Problems your company would face if they were to use Faircode licensed code.
- Alternative solutions you are currently employing and how they are working out.
- Analysis of the legal implications of the license.
- And of course, if this license is helping you we'd love to hear about that! Both from companies and developers.

Things we _don't_ have much use for:

- Opinions on Open Source _vs._ Faircode. It's just licenses, and they're solving different needs.

You can also sponsor the Kickstarter campaign (_not available yet, check back in a few days_) so we can pay the lawyers. If we raise more than we need for the lawyers, we'll donate the rest to projects on Faircode, by distributing it equally to all Faircode licensed projects on the platform.

And finally, you can help out by letting people know about this repo. Share it with your friends and on social media. We'll use the [@faircodeio](https://twitter.com/faircodeio) account on Twitter to share news.

## How do I use an alpha license?

Keep an eye on this repository as the license evolves. We'll use semver to version it (see changes in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)). We recommend upgrading to the latest version as soon as it comes out. It's not for everyone to try something new like this, but those who do will help shape what this license is and how it's used, and set examples for future developers who want to try something similar.
